**Hello! First of all, my real name isn't Makarov; it's just my nickname.**

I am makarov. who still creating our Identity.

**Why did I start writing?** Ahh, one day, I went to my relative's house to work on a website, mainly because they had Wi-Fi !. 
While I was there, a question randomly popped into my mind: ** Who is the founder of ChatGPT? ** 
I Googled it and found out it was **Sam Altman.**
That discovery led me to his blog, where I ended up reading **around 10 blogs** in one sitting. 
My head was practically exploding with a **headache** from all the reading,  but it sparked a **thought**: 

what's happend I started writing? 
And why not create a self-made writing website to known thet!
