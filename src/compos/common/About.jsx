**Hello! First of all, my real name isn't Makarov; it's just my nickname. **

I am a front-end web developer with 1.7 years of experience. I began my journey by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. **Interestingly**, it took me around 9-10 months to feel little confident in writing JavaScript a long but rewarding process. 
Now, I'm expanding my skills by learning **backend development** and building simple websites.

**Why did I start writing blogs?** Ahh, one day, I went to my relative's house to work on a website, mainly because they had Wi-Fi !. 
While I was there, a question randomly popped into my head: ** "Who is the founder of ChatGPT?" ** 
I Googled it and found out it was **Sam Altman.**
That discovery led me to his blog, where I ended up reading **around 10 blogs** in one sitting. 
My head was practically exploding with a **headache** from all the reading,  but it sparked a thought: 

what's happend I started writing blogs? 
And why not create a self-made blog website to known thet!

i write not because i like it.
i write not because i want likes.
i write not because i impressed someone.

i write because i express yourself.
i write because i express emotions.
i write because i will to become 2.0.
